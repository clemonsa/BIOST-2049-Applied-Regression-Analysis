# Introduction

Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans are a form of Medicare where beneficiaries are covered by a private company, which contracts through Medicare, to provide both Plan A and Part B benefits. 

The advantage to this form of healthcare coverage is that cost sharing may be less in comparison to the standard Medicare and out-of-pocket costs are limited. The result are cost-savings that can encourage people to partake in preventative heatlthcare, reducing the burden of using hospital resources for medical emergencies and extended stays. Many MA plans also included coverage beyond that of standard Medicare such as vision, dental, hearing aids, and prescription drug coverage.

However, there are concerns about the current push towards using MA plans in comparison to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage programs come with many restrictions, such as in doctors or facilities that accept beneficiaries in comparison to the standard Medicare. This can lead to obstacles for beneficiaries wishing to seek medical care and could have a negative effect on healthcare outcomes. Furthermore, MA plans are regional instead of national which restricts participating providers to those in which beneficiaries reside in the same area for at least 6 months of the year. This geographic restriction could discourage those who livelihoods require spending time in different locations throughout the year or increases the distance between those in rural areas to healthcare providers that accept their coverage. 

Overall while MA have their advantages for some, it has been observed that many sicker beneficiaries are less likely to use MA plans which could contribute to an increase in use hospital and emergency department resources. 

Our research question is to examine whether we can accurately use metrics of hospital readmissions and emergency department vists to predict the participation of MA enrollees.
